🧠 NETWORKING VIVA Q&A (SHORT + SORTED)


---

🌐 1. Network Topologies & Transmission Media

Q1. What is a network topology?
➡ Arrangement of nodes and cables in a network.

Q2. Types of topologies?
➡ Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, Hybrid.

Q3. Difference between physical & logical topology?
➡ Physical = actual layout; Logical = data flow path.

Q4. Advantages of star topology?
➡ Easy to add/remove devices; fault isolation.

Q5. What is a guided medium?
➡ Transmission through physical path (Twisted pair, Coaxial, Fiber).

Q6. Unguided medium?
➡ Wireless — uses air/radio signals.

Q7. Straight vs crossover cable?
➡ Straight: different devices (PC–Switch); Crossover: same devices (PC–PC).

Q8. Which cable is used in LAN?
➡ Cat5e/Cat6 twisted pair cable.

🖧 2. Wired LAN with Layer 2 Switch

Q1. What is a Layer 2 switch?
➡ Switch that forwards frames using MAC addresses.

Q2. Hub vs Switch?
➡ Hub broadcasts; Switch sends to specific MAC.

Q3. What is MAC address?
➡ Unique hardware address for a NIC.

Q4. What tool tests LAN cables?
➡ Cable tester / Line tester.

Q5. Purpose of IP addressing?
➡ To uniquely identify devices in a network.

Q6. Use of PING?
➡ Tests connectivity using ICMP packets.

Q7. What is ARP?
➡ Resolves IP address to MAC address.


---

🌍 3. WAN (Wired + Wireless LAN)

Q1. What is a WAN?
➡ Network connecting multiple LANs over large area.

Q2. LAN vs WAN?
➡ LAN = Local; WAN = Wide area via routers.

Q3. What connects LANs in a WAN?
➡ Routers.

Q4. What is SSID?
➡ Network name for a Wi-Fi network.

Q5. Access Point vs Router?
➡ AP connects wireless clients; Router connects networks.

Q6. Protocols used in WAN?
➡ PPP, MPLS, Frame Relay.


---

🚦 4. Routing (RIP / OSPF / BGP)

Q1. What is routing?
➡ Selecting best path for data transmission.

Q2. Static vs Dynamic routing?
➡ Static = manual; Dynamic = uses routing protocols.

Q3. RIP stands for?
➡ Routing Information Protocol.

Q4. Metric used by RIP?
➡ Hop count.

Q5. OSPF stands for?
➡ Open Shortest Path First (uses Dijkstra algorithm).

Q6. What is BGP?
➡ Border Gateway Protocol for inter-AS routing.

Q7. Distance-vector vs Link-state?
➡ Distance-vector = neighbor info; Link-state = entire topology info.


---

💻 5. Socket Programming (TCP / UDP)

Q1. What is a socket?
➡ Endpoint for communication between processes.

Q2. TCP vs UDP?
➡ TCP = reliable, connection-oriented; UDP = fast, connectionless.

Q3. What is a port?
➡ Logical communication endpoint (e.g., 80, 443).

Q4. Functions in TCP socket (C/Java)?
➡ socket(), bind(), listen(), accept(), connect(), send(), recv().

Q5. Which layer uses ports?
➡ Transport layer.

Q6. Can two apps use same port?
➡ No, not on same IP.


---

🗣 6. TCP Socket Programs (Hello & File Transfer)

Q1. What happens when TCP client connects?
➡ 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).

Q2. How is file transfer done?
➡ Read file, send via socket stream, write on receiver side.

Q3. Buffering?
➡ Temporary storage before sending data.

Q4. How server handles multiple clients?
➡ Using threads or select().


---

🧩 7. Wireshark Packet Capture

Q1. What is Wireshark?
➡ Network packet analyzer tool.

Q2. What is a capture filter?
➡ Defines which packets to record (e.g., tcp port 80).

Q3. Display filter?
➡ Used after capture (e.g., http).

Q4. TCP Flags?
➡ SYN (start), ACK (acknowledge), FIN (finish), RST (reset), PSH (push).

Q5. What is a 3-way handshake?
➡ SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK.

Q6. How to capture only HTTP traffic?
➡ Filter: tcp.port == 80.

Q7. How to capture HTTPS traffic?
➡ Filter: tcp.port == 443.


---

🌐 8. HTTP, HTTPS, FTP Performance

Q1. HTTP port?
➡ 80.

Q2. HTTPS port?
➡ 443.

Q3. FTP ports?
➡ 20 (data), 21 (control).

Q4. Difference HTTP vs HTTPS?
➡ HTTPS is encrypted using SSL/TLS.

Q5. FTP modes?
➡ Active and Passive.

Q6. Why HTTPS is slower?
➡ Encryption and handshake overhead.


---

🔒 9. SSL Protocol

Q1. Full form of SSL?
➡ Secure Sockets Layer.

Q2. Purpose of SSL?
➡ Secure data transfer with encryption.

Q3. SSL vs TLS?
➡ TLS is newer and more secure.

Q4. Which layer does SSL work on?
➡ Between Transport and Application (session layer conceptually).


---

🔐 10. IPsec (ESP & AH)

Q1. What is IPsec?
➡ Protocol suite for securing IP packets.

Q2. ESP stands for?
➡ Encapsulating Security Payload — provides encryption & authentication.

Q3. AH stands for?
➡ Authentication Header — provides authentication only.

Q4. OSI layer?
➡ Network layer.
